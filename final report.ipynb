    "Using the Twitter API, I have decided to gather public opinion on J.K. Rowling. A once beloved figure, she has been at the centre of controversy over the years due to her opinions on transgender rights. I had initially changed my topic to be about the death penalty in Singapore and Malaysia, but due to Twitter's 7-day limit on tweet lookups, it had become difficult to collect data. "

Specifically, the tweets/search/recent libraries were used to search for relevant tweets, when the tweets were posted, the type of tweet and the language of the tweets. As the maximum number of tweets that could be collected is 100, 100 was set as the maximum results. \n",
